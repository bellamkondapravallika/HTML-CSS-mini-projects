# 🌐 HTML & CSS Mini Projects
This repository contains my HTML & CSS mini projects and practice work created as part of my frontend development learning journey.
I built these projects to strengthen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling by practicing consistently in VS Code.
# 📌 About the Repository
This repository includes small projects and exercises that helped me improve my frontend fundamentals.
Some projects were inspired by learning platforms, and I implemented and practiced them independently.
