<div id="how_it_works">
  <h1>How it works</h1>
  <h3>Lakmé lipsticks work by using pigments and binders to create a colored, smooth-gliding formula that adheres to the lips. The specific mechanism depends on the product type, such as a liquid lipstick that dries down to a matte, transfer-resistant finish, or a matte bullet lipstick that provides a velvety, smooth color. Some formulas are also enriched with moisturizing ingredients like argan oil or vitamin E to nourish the lips and provide long-lasting hydration. </h3>
